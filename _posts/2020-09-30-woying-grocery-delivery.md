--------------------------

Update 2020-11-05: The website is unavailable due to the stopped service of this organisation. But you
 can still see the design and logic of the website.


This website is developed using ReactJS library and supported by Restful API designed by OCMA. It helps people login, fill in address information, select merchandise, add to cart and check out. Clients' orders will
be saved and sent to the back end server. The grocery distributor would write down and prepare food for
customers with a delivery date. People will receive their orders in the right time without any worry.
The website is well designed and well-functioning.

This single page website is a team work project that provide a place for restaurant owners to build
 their menu introductions and dishes presentations. Here, people can register and login their own
  account and input their basic information. The essential function of the website is to add, delete, modify and search dishes in the menu. Enter the name, upload the picture, write descriptions and set up the price. Is that simple, right?
